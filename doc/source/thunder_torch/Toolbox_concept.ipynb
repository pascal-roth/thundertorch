    "Toolbox Concept \n",
    "===============\n",
    "\n",
    "The given Toolbox is build on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.2.0/) (Version: 1.2) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.6/) (Version: 0.7.6). It should enable you to use Machine Learning in an easy and understandable way, as well as remove the need to implement everything on your own. In particular, the Toolbox is constructed with the aim that for most tasks only a few parameters have to be defined and you don't have to worry about how to build a model, how to use GPUs for training, and so on. However, certain knowledge about Machine Learning is required in order to properly adjust the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical ML task in the toolbox requires three different parts: [DataLoader](./getting_started/DataLoader.html), [Model](./getting_started/Models.html) and [Trainer](./getting_started/Trainer.html). In order to understand their usage, we want to consider a tabulated chemistry approach where the table is replaced by a NN. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Firstly, data will be split into look-up variables (=inputs) and the thermochemical properties that should be predicted (=outputs). Possible pre-processing options such as normalization are performed simultaneously.  Both tasks are included in the [DataLoader](./getting_started/DataLoader.html)\n",
    "2. Secondly, the [ML Model](./getting_started/Models.html) which learns the underlying function in the data is constructed by the definition of the hyperparameter.\n",
    "3. Lastly, the PyTorch Lightining [Trainer](./getting_started/Trainer.html) is employed to execute the \"learning\" process of the thermochemical properties. The [Model](./getting_started/Models.html) and [DataLoader](./getting_started/DataLoader.html) are given as inputs, together with other flags that can impact training as well as testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, components can be defined in order to influence and individualize each of the previous steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Callbacks](./getting_started/Callbacks.html) \n",
    "- [Metrics](./getting_started/Metrics.html)\n",
    "- [Individual Modules](./getting_started/Individualized_modules.html) \n",
    "\n",
    "The toolbox provides a YAML interface (recommended to use!) for single and multi model training. The interface is automatically adjusted for the intended DataLoader and Model (if pre-constructed in the toolbox). Besides, the toolbox files can be included in individual scripts to execute any desired task. However, the multi model training is optimized for the yaml template and has to be modified in order to use a complete code based implementation. Both strategies can be combined. A detailed explanation for the YAML interface is provided unter the following locations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [YAML single model](./working_examples/working_example_yaml.html)\n",
    "- [YAML multi model](./getting_started/MultiModelTraining.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the full potential of the different classes, you are encouraged to use the different instructions as well as the documentation for the different scripts. In order to better understand how to work with the toolbox, working examples are provided. One for each input strategy and one to explore the usage of a CNN for classification (using the popular Mnist dataset).\n",
